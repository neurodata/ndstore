Description: ===============================
        "Minimum" and "Maximum" Objects
        ===============================
        
        The ``peak.util.extremes`` module provides a production-quality implementation
        of the ``Min`` and ``Max`` objects from PEP 326.  While PEP 326 was rejected
        for inclusion in the language or standard library, the objects described in it
        are useful in a variety of applications.  In PEAK, they have been used to
        implement generic functions (in RuleDispatch and PEAK-Rules), as well as to
        handle scheduling and time operations in the Trellis.  Because this has led to
        each project copying the same code, we've now split the module out so it can
        be used independently.
        
        Some simple usage examples::
        
            >>> from peak.util.extremes import Min, Max
            >>> import sys
        
            >>> Min < -sys.maxint
            True
            >>> Min < None
            True
            >>> Min < ''
            True
            >>> Max > sys.maxint
            True
            >>> Max > 99999999999999999
            True
        
            >>> type(Min)
            <class 'peak.util.extremes.Extreme'>
        
        The ``Min`` object compares less than any other object but itself, while the
        ``Max`` object compares greater than any other object but itself.  Both are
        instances of the ``Extreme`` type.
        
        While the original PEP 326 implementation of these extreme values is shorter
        than the version used here, it contains a flaw: it does not correctly handle
        comparisons with classic class instances.  Therefore, this version defines
        methods for all six rich comparison operators, to ensure correct support for
        classic as well as new-style classes::
        
            >>> Max >= Min and Max > Min and Max==Max and Max!=Min
            True
            >>> Max < Min or Max <= Min or Max==Min or Max!=Max
            False
        
            >>> Min <= Max and Min < Max and Min==Min and Min!=Max
            True
            >>> Min > Max or Min >= Max or Min==Max or Min!=Min
            False
        
            >>> class X:
            ...     """Ensure rich comparisons work correctly with classic classes"""
        
            >>> x = X()
        
            >>> Min<x<Max and Min<=x<=Max and Min!=x!=Max and Max!=x!=Min
            True
            
            >>> Min>x or x>Max or x<=Min or x>=Max or x==Min or Min==x
            False
