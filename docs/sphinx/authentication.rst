Authentication
**************

**Overview**
The security authentication for ndstore applies to any endpoint that is specified as secured for non-public data. The docs are broken into three parts; user access, endpoint security and tests. If you are a user of the service you should only need to deal with the first section. If you are writing endpoints for ndstore then you should review the later two sections as well.

**Interacting with the Endpoints**

**Securing an Endpoint**

**Security Testing**
As outlined above, in order to access non-private data the user must send a token with the request to identify themselves.
