Example scripts that demonstrate how to use the service.

#########   Unsupported scripts   #########

Used for internal testing only now.

  addCubeIndex.py
  cutout.py
  getId.py

#########  RAMON Interfaces #########

***  XXXwrite.py -- write a randomly generated RAMON object to the database
    XXX = synapse, segment, neuron, seed, or anno (anno=minimal object)

***  annoread.py -- read a ramon object from a database polymorphically
    there are options to fetch data as voxels or cutout
   

#########  Other Queries #########

***  listofids.py -- fetch all annotations matching type and status criteria
    this is a metadata only query


#########  Data Annotation #########

***  addcube/denseaddcube.py -- write an annotation to the database specified as a cube
    using either dense or sparse interfaces

***  addcube/denseaddcube.py -- write an annotation to the database specified as a cube
    using either dense or sparse interfaces

***  [dense]anno[black|white].py -- sparse or dense interfaces to read a cutout from a database
    and write annotations of the same shape.  These are still pretty customized for hayworth5nm
    and probably not the usable.


#########  Deprecated scripts in deprecated   #########

*** hdf5MakePNGs.py

  Get an HDF5 file from the cutout service and write a series of PNG files that show the data

*** npzMakePNGs.py

  Get an NPZ (Numpy zip) file from the cutout service and write a series of PNG files that show the data

*** annotatewhite.py

  Read a cube of data and write annotations for the whitest pixels.  Uses both cutout and annotate service.

*** addcube.py

  Add annotations as a cube
